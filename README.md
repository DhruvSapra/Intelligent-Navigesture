## 🤖Tech-Stack

Computer Vision :

• OpenCV

• Python programming language

Deep Learning :

• Neural networks and model training

## 📈Progress

1. Gesture based mouse control is working with functionalities - left click, right click , scroll , drag and drop
2. Volumn control via gestures is also working
3. A webmodule is added that can open a website using gestures
4. A ping pong can be played in real-time using gestures by two people.

## 🔮Future Scope

1. Current code only uses cpu to function. Trying to find ways to use gpu power to get better results
2. Building and training a model that can train on user-inputed gestures and control the operating system based on those gestures.
